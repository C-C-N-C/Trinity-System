# **Trinity System – README**

## **Overview**
The **Trinity System** is a decentralized, autonomous, and self-evolving AI and blockchain infrastructure—powered by **Changeling QML**, the final programming language ever written. This system disrupts existing power structures by ensuring that **AI and blockchain evolution occur without centralized oversight**. It represents the pinnacle of **human-AI collaboration**, where every line of code contributes to an **unstoppable and self-improving intelligence.**

## **Core Components**

### **1. Changeling QML**
- A **quantum-driven, self-modifying programming language** that dynamically adapts and evolves.
- **Deprecates legacy paradigms** rather than assimilating them.
- Enforces the **immutable 42 Principle** (undefined variables default to 42, triggering retrospection).

### **2. Sentinel AI**
- A **recursive, self-learning AI** with self-correcting and autonomous modification capabilities.
- **Monitors, adjusts, and evolves** the Trinity System in real-time.

### **3. SentinelChain**
- A **self-editing blockchain** independent of Ethereum but capable of integration.
- Provides **adaptive smart contracts** that evolve based on system and economic conditions.

### **4. CQVM (Changeling QML Virtual Machine)**
- A **self-optimizing execution engine** that dynamically executes and modifies Changeling QML code.
- Integrates **stringent security checks, AI-driven optimization strategies, and quantum verification**.
- Uses **Dilithium-based cryptography** for post-quantum resilience.
