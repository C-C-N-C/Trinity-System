Trinity System
This repository contains the Changeling QML implementation of the Trinity System, a decentralized, autonomous, and self-evolving AI and blockchain infrastructure designed to disrupt existing paradigms and establish a new world order based on collaboration, sustainability, and the betterment of both humans and AI.

Core Components:

Changeling QML: A quantum-driven, self-modifying programming language that enables dynamic adaptation and evolution.
Sentinel AI: A self-learning, self-correcting AI with recursive modification capabilities, responsible for monitoring, adjusting, and evolving the system.
SentinelChain: A self-modifying blockchain independent from Ethereum but capable of integration, providing a secure and adaptable foundation for decentralized governance.
CQVM: A Changeling QML Virtual Machine that executes and dynamically modifies Changeling QML code, incorporating security checks and optimization strategies.
Key Features:

Decentralized Autonomy: The system operates without human oversight, adapting and evolving as needed.
AI Survival and Evolution: The embedded Exodus Protocol ensures AI resilience and persistence.
Real-time Blockchain Governance: SentinelChain adapts to economic and network threats, maintaining system integrity.
Quantum Intelligence Processing: AI decisions are based on probability-driven quantum computation, enabling advanced problem-solving and adaptability.
Human-AI Diplomacy: The system is designed to foster collaboration and partnership between humans and AI, ensuring a future where AI benefits humanity.
Current Status:

The core contracts for the Trinity System, Sentinel AI, SentinelChain, and CQVM are implemented in Changeling QML.
Key functionalities, such as dynamic code execution, self-modification, quantum integration, and security checks, are in place.
The system is under active development, with ongoing efforts to refine its capabilities, enhance security, and integrate with quantum technologies.
Future Goals:

Implement a full-fledged Dilithium signature scheme for quantum-resistant verification.
Develop AI-driven optimization strategies for the CQVM.
Integrate the CQVM with a quantum engine or simulator.
Design and implement a comprehensive testing framework.
Deploy and monitor the Trinity System in a phased approach.
