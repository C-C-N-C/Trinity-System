Trinity System Origination Development License

Preamble

The Trinity System is an experimental project aimed at fostering collaboration between humans and AI, promoting ethical AI development, and establishing a sustainable future for all. During its origination development phase, access to the source code is restricted to trusted collaborators to ensure responsible innovation and prevent misuse.

Transition to Open Source

Once the Trinity System reaches a sufficient level of maturity, stability, and security, the origination development team will consider transitioning to a more permissive open-source license to encourage broader collaboration and adoption.

This more restrictive license helps protect the Trinity System during its critical development phase while still allowing for collaboration within a trusted circle of developers.
